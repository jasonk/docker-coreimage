jasonk/coreimage - An opinionated Docker base image
==============================================

This image is intended for use with [my docker-builder
tools](http://github.com/jasonk/docker-builder) (though there is no reason you
couldn't use it on it's own).  It provides a minimal framework on which to
build a [Docker](http://www.docker.io/) container.

The image is based on an ubuntu base, with a minimal runtime that still
provides the necessary services for running and managing containers that
provide multiple services.

What is included in this image?
=================

 * [Ubuntu 13.10 - Saucy Salamander](http://www.ubuntu.com/)
    * base image 
 * [ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home)
    * ansible for it automation
 * [runit](http://smarden.org/runit/)
    * as the init process and service supervisor
 * [xinetd](http://www.xinetd.org)
    * super-server daemon
 * [cron](http://ftp.isc.org/isc/cron/)
    * for periodic task running
 * [docker-utils](http://github.com/jasonk/docker-utils)
   * Helpful utility scripts for docker environments

Getting Started
===============

If you just want to take a look at what is in the image, the easiest way is to
run this command:

    docker run --rm -t -i jasonk/coreimage bash

This will download the image if you don't already have it, and start it up in
docker.  Keep in mind that running it this way it will run bash instead of
runit, so none of the services will actually start.

Configuration Tool
==================

This image contains a very helpful tool, named 'docker-coreimage'.  You can use
it to easily configure the most important parts of the container.  I recommend
reviewing the source code if you want to see the details of how each of these
things is done.

See the [Wiki](http://github.com/jasonk/docker-coreimage/wiki) for more details
about how to perform common tasks.

Test Suite
==========

The startup process for this image includes a script that checks whether
/test-suite is a mountpoint.  If it is a mountpoint, then the startup script
launches a background process that sleeps for 15 seconds, then changes
directory to /test-suite, and runs any executables it finds there.

You can use this to run an automated test suite against the image, by mounting
a local directory on /test-suite, like so:

    docker run -v /path/to/test-suite:/test-suite -t -i --rm jasonk/coreimage

The distribution includes a test harness that uses
[roundup.sh](https://github.com/bmizerany/roundup) to run any test scripts
found in the tests/ directory.  You can either use that harness as-is and add
your own tests to the tests directory, or just replace the whole thing with
whatever test runner you would prefer.

Configuring Services
====================

There are two kinds of services supported by this image:  Persistent services
managed by runit, and on-demand services managed by xinetd.  Running through
runit is good for the applications that your container is intended to run,
while xinetd is very helpful for launching management processes and things
that don't need to be running all the time.

The default configuration uses runit to manage xinetd and cron, and uses xinetd
to manage some helpful network utilities.

The service configuration for all services is stored in /srv/services.  You can
see what services are available in an image by looking at the contents of this
directory.  Subdirectories of /srv/services contain configuration for runit,
while xinetd configured services just have a file in /srv/services.

    % ls -F /srv/services
    cron/   sshd    xinetd/

Building your own images based on jasonk/coreimage
==================================================

To build your own image, you can either use [my docker-builder
tool](http://github.com/jasonk/docker-builder), or create your own Dockerfile.

    % ls
    Dockerfile install.sh cleanup.sh
    % cat Dockerfile
    # Use jasonk/baseimage as the base image.  If you want reproducible builds
    # you should specify a specific version, rather than :latest.
    FROM jasonk/coreimage:<VERSION>
    
    # Set correct environment variables.
    ENV HOME /root

    # Run whatever additional commands you want to run here..
    RUN ....
